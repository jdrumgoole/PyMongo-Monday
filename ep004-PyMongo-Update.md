# PyMongo Monday - EP03 - Update

This is part 4 of PyMongo Monday. Previously we have
covered:

 * EP1
 * EP2
 * EP2
 
 We are now into *Update*, the *U* in CRUD. The key aspect of update is the 
 ability to change a document in place. In order for this to happen we must
 have some way to select and document and change parts of that documemt.
