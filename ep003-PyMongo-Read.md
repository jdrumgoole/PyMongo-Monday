# PyMongo - Episode 3 - Create

Previously we covered:
 * Episode 1 : Setting Up Your MongoDB Environment
 * Episode 2 : CRUD - Create
 
In this episode (episode 3) we are are going to cover
the Read part of CRUD. MongoDB provides a query interface
through the [find](http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/pymongo/collection.html#pymongo.collection.Collection.find) 
function.

We are going to demonstrate by doing finds on a collection
hosted in MongoDB Atlas. The MongoDB connection string for
the collection we are going to use is:

`mongodb+srv://demo:demo@demodata-rgl39.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true`
